## About the Collection

StoryCorps is an organization whose mission is to preserve and share humanity’s stories in order to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world. StoryCorps allows individuals to record stories, to record interviews with other people, with the intent of helping them connect, understand, and be compassionate towards one another. These digital stories are then added not only to StoryCorps’s online archive, but to the Library of Congress for future generations to reference, appreciate, and learn from.

At the beginning of each semester, students receive the following prompt in their English 100 course:

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
