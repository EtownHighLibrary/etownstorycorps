## About the Etown StoryCorps Collection

StoryCorps is an organization whose mission is "to preserve and share humanity’s stories in order to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world." StoryCorps allows individuals to record stories, to record interviews with other people, with the intent of helping them connect, understand, and be compassionate towards one another. These digital stories are then added not only to StoryCorps’s online archive, but to the Library of Congress for future generations to reference, appreciate, and learn from.

At the beginning of each semester, students receive the following prompt in their English 100 course:

Right now, you should start thinking of someone in your life whom you might want to interview. Who inspires you? Who do you want to know more about? Who do you want to ask that burning question to? The one you’ll regret not asking? What do you want to ask them about: religion? race? music? forgiveness?

The prompt is intended to give students permission to enter a space of communication, to use their own style of discourse and their own curiosity to learn more about another person and the world. Since the start of the English 100 StoryCorps experience, these stories have also started to accumulate into this digital archive with Elizabethtown College’s High Library. The goal of the project is not only to introduce students to the real-life, practical applications of reading and writing, but to connect individuals in the profoundly human experience of storytelling.

Enjoy the stories!

Professor Biever-Grodzinski
